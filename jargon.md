# Jargon

Here's common jargon that makes literally no sense if you don't know anything
about CrossFit.

I tried my best to group them by context.


## Workout Types

- AMRAP
- EMOM
- "For time... Cap..."


## Grips

- Full grip
- Hook grip
- False grip


## Barbells

- Power
- Jerk
- Clean
- Snatch
- Split



## Etc.

- Box
- Calories
- Rx (Prescribed)
