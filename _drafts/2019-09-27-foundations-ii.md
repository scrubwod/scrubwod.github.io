*(Written retrospectively, so honestly probably forgot something)*

Today was moving around the barbell off of the rack.

- Fan Bike
    - Seat height: 4

### Pushes

### Squats

### Bailing

### Broad Strokes

Remember to activate all of your muscles. You're naturally a sedentary being
and forget to use muscles that you have.

## WOD

For Time:
- 200m Run
- 6 Push Presses
- 7 Front Squats
- 8 Burpees

I actually don't know how long this took me. This was really taxing for me.
