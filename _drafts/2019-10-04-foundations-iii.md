This final session was learning how to get the barbell off of the floor.

Here are some form tips I received and that I found around the web.

### Deadlift

Fun and easy.

### Snatch

I think I need to drive my shoulder blades down more?

### Clean

I hate these - I'm so bad at it and I don't know why.

### Broad Strokes

These movements will get better after volume. I am looking at climbing as a
reference: When starting to boulder, there are a lot of things that your mind
and body is not used to, and it's difficult to work on technique when there are
other parts of climbing occupying parts of your mind.

I think the same thing is happening with the snatch and clean for me - It's not
very straight-forward to get perfect technique when I have so many other things
I need to be comfortable with first that are continuing to occupy my mind. I
think rep volume will help, regardless of how imperfect they are. I think I
need to focus on other things, like breathing, foot placement, hand placement,
engaging my legs and shoulders, before trying to perfectly do the motion
completely.

I wish there were mirrors in CrossFit gyms. It would be extremely helpful for
self-correcting. At least for me, It's one thing to be doing the wrong thing
and not "feeling" why. It's another thing to be doing the wrong thing and
seeing yourself do it wrong. Sounds like there aren't mirrors as [a means to
abolish vanity-related
motivations](https://treehouserecovery.com/addiction-blog/the-benefits-of-working-out-with-no-mirrors-crossfit-philosophy/).
It's a shame because I think it would help really solidify and improve
movements at least for the Olympic lifts.

## WOD

Barbell was 55lbs.

Three rounds for time, 10 minute cap:
- 8 Calorie Bike
- 7 Deadlifts
- 6 Snatches
- 5 Wallballs
- 4 Cleans

I was able to complete the WOD somewhere around 9:40.

The third round I was exhausted and my coach needed to remind me to think about
my form: I needed to get lower for the wallball, my butt needed to be lower for
the deadlift and clean. It's not that I forgot what the form was, my body was
forcing adjustments because I was super tired. I hope with time, my body
doesn't need to adjust and I can just push without compromising form.

I am writing this post about 13 hours after and I'm already feeling the lactic
acid buildup and the DOMS.

It seems like, at face-value, WODs might be harmful for a beginner learning
these movements and techniques. I mean that if you tell a scrub (me) to do
these movements within the time allotted and as fast as possible, proper form
and technique unfortunately becomes secondary. I know better now and I am now
comfortable not finishing in time, so long as my technique is as good as I can
get it every time.

    - Hook grip, narrow grip
    - Feet more parallel, narrow between grip
    - Bar should touch shins at start; Shins should be fairly perpendicular to
      ground
    - Pull up when above ankles, seems like limited from how straight you can
      keep your arms and how high you can shrug your shoulders
    - Jump out to wider stance, drive elbows out to the front rack position,
      hit bottom of the squat
- [Craig Richey w/ Sonny Webster, How to Snatch](https://youtu.be/Nh4X2loPVUo?t=143)
    - Bum height is where knees align with arms, i.e. the bar, your knees, and
      your arms should lie on a single plane
- [CrossFit Jääkarhu, What is Triple Extension](https://youtu.be/g2lbEjrS1oo)
    - Bar should be moving straight, perpendicularly to the ground
    - To achieve this movement, pull should be up, leading with elbows and
      shoulders up (instead of backwards, with an arch of the back)

  powerful](https://youtu.be/lvWmQeBXvmk?t=292)
