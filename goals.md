### Max So Far

These are the heaviest weights I've done the movement with.

- Front Squat: 135lb _(3 reps; 1RM should only be a handful of pounds more)_
- Overhead Squat: 90lb _(4 reps, 2-2-2 tempo; 1RM could probably be more)_
- Squat Snatch: 75lb _(For 3 rep WOD; Need to practice form, but likely can build more)_
- Power Snatch: 100lb _(1RM)_
- Squat Clean: 95lb _(Did as part of C&J 1RM)
- Power Clean: 95lb _(21 singles were pretty easy)_
- Strict Overhead Press: 75lb _(5 reps; Struggled)_
