I know myself well enough to know that if I go way too hard at something, I
will surely burn out and a little break will turn into a forever-break. For
this reason, I'm trying my best to start off with CrossFit fairly slowly and
been going to the box 2-3 times a week, with at least one rest day between.

I'm still climbing at a moderate level on one or two of my off-days, so it's
not like I'm completely sedentary outside of CrossFit. Thanks to CrossFit, I've
actually been hitting the treadmill and the rowing machine at my climbing gym
to add some points to my endurance (which I need *badly*).

My current struggle is not knowing what point I should move into the deeper end
and go 3-4 times a week. I already noticed that the WOD programming at the gym
is fairly consistent on what days target what. I've been going Tues/Thurs and
I've been hitting similar movements. This is not a bad thing, because I still
need to grease the groove and become more comfortable with the movements (a
little more on this later). But I think I'm missing out on the other parts of
the programming.

Just a little blob of my struggle. (One of many.)

### Part A

Seated overhead presses: Four rounds of 8.

The coach recommended racking the barbell "normally" (at your shoulder height,
standing) and then backing up into the bench to sit and then do the presses.
Considering that this was my second time I did an overhead press, this went
more successfully than the first - **Uphill projection, baby!**

I recalled that my last strict overhead press (standing) maxed at 75lb for
three reps. I started with 55lb. Solid. Added to 65lb. Solid. Added to 75lb.
Solid, but it was hard. We already did it, boys! I kept 75lb and squeezed out 8
more, with ease (relative to the last time - I could barely do 3!).

Sick.

*I understand that seated is a little easier, but whatever! I think I'm
getting stronger!*


### WOD

18 Minute EMOM: (Rx: 165lb)
1. 9 deadlifts @ 125lb
2. 6 clean and jerk @ 75lb
2. 3 snatch @ 75lb

*Side note: I want to see someone do a Rx WOD. That shit sounds nuts.*

The coach mentioned that we can use two barbells, so I did. I can deadlift
**WAY** more than I can clean/jerk/snatch. She mentioned that I should go a
little heavier for the deadlift since this was the case. Knowing we were doing
54 deadlifts total, 125lb is definitely on the heavier side for me.

Deadlifts were fine, I think. Not much too it. I did notice that everyone else
was so quick at cycling out 9 reps, and I was going noticeably slower. Everyone
was done by the time I did 6. I think I need to keep in mind that power and
strength are separate, but complimentary. I'm strong enough to deadlift 125lb
54 times, but I'm not powerful enough to deadlift 125lb at a quicker rate. So I
think for deadlifts (**and deadlifts only**), I should focus on power and
trying to get the bar off of the ground quicker.

Clean and jerk. This was actually a lot easier than I thought. I think my clean
is in a better place, but can definitely use more work. I was cleaning without
doing that power hop, which is bad. The jerk felt ok though, despite doing
32 strict overhead presses already.

Snatch. Trash. What's new?

Ok I already mentioned this in a previous post, but again, the coach mentioned
that I need to keep my butt down on the first pull. Honestly, during the WOD I
couldn't feel a difference. I don't know if I was too wiped to have awareness
or what, but I *tried* to keep my butt down as much as I could.

### Keep your fucking butt down, please

I found a reference video:

[The Daily BS: How To Prevent Your Butt From
Shooting Up When You Snatch and
Clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmi4zBuekF8&feature=youtu.be)

Seems good.

- **First pull does not need to be fast**
- First pull to get you to a good position to do the second pull
- Focus on pressing your knees back
- Focus on maintaining the angle of your back
- Try clean/snatch deadlifts

General notes again (for me):

- Knees out
- Look up
- Engage shoulders
- Hook grip **and release**
- **JUMP**

**Let's get better, ya'll!**
