ScrubWOD is a blog created by a scrub. This scrub has a fairly poor grasp of
English composition, but has enough technical know-how to make a little blog
where he can do whatever he wants!

This scrub is also not afraid to be always be a scrub! You can only go up if
you're a scrub! This blog is for all of the scrubs, because scrubs can learn!

**Being a scrub is NOT a bad thing!**

ScrubWOD will act as a journal following a new scrub trying to "do CrossFit".

He wants to remember what was fun, what was hard, and how to improve to make
hard things easier.

He also wants to hold himself accountable (he hears accountability is a large
part of the CrossFit culture). He's very easily distracted and wants to give
CrossFit a fair fight for a place in his heart as a life-long activity. This is
basically a lame version of "The Bachelor".

This scrub is a forever-scrub, but hopefully these posts provide evidence that
**anyone** can learn to be less of a scrub.
