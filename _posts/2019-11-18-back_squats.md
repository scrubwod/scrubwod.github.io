Today I've learned to come into the class with expectations, but be prepared to
just throw them out the window when needed.

Like usual, I looked at the class WOD and noticed that the first part was a
back squat. I haven't done a back squat since the foundation session. I have
done a front squat and remembered there are rules of thumb about percentages.
I did some research to see how much I should be able to back squat with a given
front squat number, the first Google result said:

> The Back Squat to Front Squat ratio is somewhere between 80% â€“ 90%"

My current max front squat is 135lb. The WOD said to build to about 80%, so
this is already a good final number that I had come into the box planning on
hitting, probably going up 10lbs every round.

Come with expectations, but be prepared to throw them out.

### Back Squats

The coach asked "Who doesn't know their 1RM?" Someone else in the class and I
raised our hands. I think he has a good idea of my fitness level, so I trusted
him. I warmed up with 5s and 10s. We were to do 6 rounds of 4 reps.

1. 4x75lb (15s)
2. 4x95lb (25s)
3. 4x105lb (25s + 5s)

After the third round, the coach had the other person and me do 3 reps, 2 reps,
and finally 1 rep so we can know a number in the ballpark of our max.

4. 3x115lb (25s + 10s)
5. 2x135lb (25s + 10s + 10s)
6. 1x155lb (25s + 10s + 10s + 10s)

Not only did I hit a PR/BW goal, I have a good number for my max. I felt a little
faint after standing it back up, so I think it was right around my max.

### WOD

15 minute EMOM, cycling each minutes:
1. 100m run
2. 4 Box bar muscle up (rx: ring muscle up)
3. 8 Thruster @ 75lb (rx: 115lb)

The coach wanted me to try out some ring movements. Shit was hard. I can't
really do bodyweight ring dips (and cold for that matter). I subbed box muscle
ups instead. I tried them with the shortest side of the box, and I tried my
best not to use my legs to jump off. I want to get the bar muscle up so badly!

Thrusters are still tough when trying to cycle 8 unbroken. During the workout I
noticed that I kept bending backwards during the thrusters. After talking to
the coach, I think I need to work on contracting/extending my neck
back/forward. Instead of isolating my neck, I'm bending backward and end up
losing my balance. I can isolate my neck, but it's mostly a matter of timing,
so I practice a few reps with the training barbell.

All in all, good day.
