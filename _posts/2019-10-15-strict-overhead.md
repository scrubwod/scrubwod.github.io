I woke up in the middle of the night before and couldn't get back to sleep,
which was a bummer. It was an actual struggle waking up and thinking I felt
rested enough to throw myself into the box. I typically like to defer taking it
easy on myself and try my best not to wreak havoc on my body, but this morning
I drank a bunch of water, forced myself to move around, drank a bit of protein
shake, ate a banana and a granola bar, and took a little bit of C4 to  do my
best to wake myself up.

I think, unless I hurt myself, it's hard to regret going to the gym or
exercising. This is how I felt after I got out. Even on 4 hours of interrupted
sleep, and waking up at 5 in the morning, I had too much serotonin after the
WOD to regret it.

### Strict Overhead Pressing

Part A of the class consisted of doing a 10 minute EMOM of 5 strict overhead
presses. We were supposed to start light and build up. Unfortunately for me,
the barbell itself was really heavy for me to strict press.

My box usually posts on their Facebook page and their website the upcoming WOD
and I've been using it just to mentally prepare. "Oh, we're going to be doing
cleans, let's review the form that goes into the clean so I don't waste reps."
When I read "strict press" EMOM, I thought I would be ok - Boy, I was
**WRONG**!

- Minute 1 - 45lb: I started with just the bar. A little heavy, but I could
  squeeze out five. "I could probably do more," as I add 5s to each side for
  the second minute.
- Minute 2 - 55lb: "Oohf, this is tough," I think, as I add 5s again to each
  side for the third minute.
- Minute 3 - 65lb: I fight to push out five. "What does building mean?" as I
  replace 5s on each side with 10s.
- Minute 4 - 75lb: When I notice it's going downhill. I squeeze out five, but it
  took the full minute, no rest time, and we have six more rounds to go. I
  "build" with 5lb on each side again.
- Minute 5 - 85lb: I am literally crumbling. My shoulders are beginning to cry.
  I can't do five in the minute. I squeeze out four hard pushes. I take the 5s
  off really quickly. For the next round.
- Minute 5-10 - 75lb: I struggle **HARD**, but I'm fighting to not take off any
  more weights. Breathing. I also end up doing small push presses, and _I don't
  care_.

Afterwards I come out of my little cave and notice **how fucking much everyone
is strict pressing**. How are you strict pressing almost **double** what I'm
pressing?

It's absolutely inspiring.

Only my shoulders were crushed, but I really directed **all** of my energy into
those damn presses. But, time to get ready for the WOD.

### WOD

4RFT, 16 minute cap:
- 10 Hang power clean @ 75lb (Rx: 165lb)
- 20 Alt pistol squats
- 5 DU attempts + 200 singles (Rx: 100 DU)

I ended with 2 rounds + 30 reps.

When we were going over the WOD at the beginning of class, someone mentioned to
me that I'd probably be able to do a pistol squat because of my squat
flexibility. My response: :man_shrugging: "Maybe one- Not sure about 20!" - We
used the rig to support us to warm up pistol squats and the coach told me to
let go. I did. I did a pistol squat. The coach told me to do pistol squats for
the WOD. Great. :sweat_smile: This ended up eating a lot of WOD time.

Power cleans, we meet again, my enemy. During the WOD, feels crappy. I think
it's the quick small baby jump to get under the bar that's the worst part. An
equally bad part is the "second pull" contacting my thigh with the bar. All
bad. During the WOD I tried going slow to [grease the
groove](https://www.freeletics.com/en/blog/posts/greasing-the-groove/). A
friendly face gave me some pointers afterwards, but still *feels so shit and
I'm so sad about it*.

Doubleunders. I still don't get the timing and how everyone does it so easily.
Doing **200** really really really ate into the WOD time. I'm sure I could have
finished at least three rounds if I had doubleunders.

All-in-all, not a bad session, but I was toast after.

### Call for help

In an attempt to get better resources to learn how to powerlift, I asked my
friends through social media if anyone had resources to get better at
power/olympic lifting.

Here are some resources that were given to me, that I have yet to look at or
implement:
- [r/weightlifting](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/wiki/index)
- [Juggernaut Training Systems](https://www.jtsstrength.com/)
- [Catalyst Athletics](https://www.catalystathletics.com/)
- Record yourself; Again the mirror-less thing throws me off, but I think this
  might be a helpful move.

I'm so ready to get out of the technique hump and really get into it.
