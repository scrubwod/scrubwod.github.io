Today someone was dropping into the gym. Dude was stocky, had a lot of mass,
and he had the fit of a CrossFit athelete. He ended up being the other male in
the class and ended up being my partner for the first part of the session. We
were pairing up to share the rack for bench presses.

The scrub in me was already nervous, plus now I have to pair with someone who
looks like he can do probably 200% more than whatever my max is (and he did).

### The Bench

After we got the bench settled under the rig, he ran over to grab his towel
because he mentioned he was a sweaty guy and didn't want to sweat up the bench.
When it was his turn, he lined the bench with his towel; I instantly knew he
had to be good dude.

I based whatever my bench press max would be by my close-grip, which is 75lb.
We were to do this scheme, building up to a heavy single:

> 2 sets x 5 reps
> 3 sets x 3 reps
> 5 sets x 1 reps

My initial thoughts were, start light, end around 90lb maybe?

I honestly don't remember the progression; It was a blur. But my partner was
incredibly nice. He talked me through the reps, gave me suggestions on how I
should build for the next set, and most importantly motivated me to do more
than I thought I could do. __I ended up bench pressing a rep of 125lb__. I
think he maxed somewhere around 245lb. I really appreciate(d) him being a
really thoughtful and empathetic partner.

I also learned how to spot, and had to spot him because he couldn't fully
extend the press back up, and that shit was __heavy__.

### The WOD

12 min AMRAP:

- 10 Thrusters @ 65lb (rx: 75lb)
- 8 box knee shoulder presses (rx: HSPU)
- 6 devil's press @ 35lbs (rx: 50lbs)
- Accomplished 3 + 7

Remember when I said I loved thrusters. I amend that to be, I love heavy
thrusters. Fuck WOD thrusters, man. That shit is brutal.

Devil's presses are also trash. Real struggle bus. But like always, I felt
toast, but good afterwords.

The dude ended up chatting around with everyone, mentioning he was only in the
area for a little bit. There happened to be a bunch of bananas that a few of us
ended up sharing, post-workout snack. Then he mentioned it would be a great
snack while he waited for an Uber back to his hotel. I ended up offering him a
ride back to his hotel, and he was a solid dude all the way. His hotel was
relatively close, but he told me he jogged from the hotel to the box (2.5
miles). Never really offered someone I just met a ride before, but after
pairing with him, I could tell he was a good dude and it was no big deal.

From my one month of CrossFit, I've met people that have been sticking with
CrossFit and they're generally good people. I'm a big fan of the community, at
least as far as I've seen. It's a bonus getting to know good people, on top of
getting healthier, stronger, and more active.

I like communities that are kind and friendly, even if it is competitive when
the time calls for it.
