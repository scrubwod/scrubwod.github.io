6am. First class with a different coach. My bum right wrist doesn't feel so
hot for some reason.

**But let's do it!**

I didn't change _what_ I ate for breakfast - BUT I woke up at 4:45a and ate
earlier which I think helped get the energy into my system by the time of the
workout. I didn't feel so bad during or after the class (in regards to my
stomach; my body was **physically toast**).

There was also a little puppy (\*puppy to mean any dog; the dog looked fairly
old) in the gym!

And more snatches! More snatches! More snatches!

### Warm up

We warmed up with, what seems like a typical, PVC warm up to wake up and open
our shoulders: Some [shoulder
dislocates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpXtyFYMSKg), some pot stirring,
some straight-arm leaning on the pipe to stretch out the tops of our backs,
maybe some motions bringing each elbow through the negative space of the pipe
and your shoulders, etc.

(Because I forgot the word "dislocate", I ended up doing a google search and
found this, what seems like a good, [resource for improving mobility using a
PVC pipe](https://www.shape.com/fitness/tips/pvc-pipe-mobility-exercises). I
think I might incorporate this in a daily mobility routine that I need to
implement; More on this soon..)

We also did a few kettlebell swings. I found that 35 is moderately heavy for
me; I could probably use a heavier weight if the movement calls for two hands.
For one-handed movements, I think 25 is a good weight for now, particularly
because of my dumb wrists. We also did this thing where we used one arm to
press a fairly light, 15 lb, kettlebell, slowly, focusing on our shoulders. The
coach mentioned it was to wake up shoulder stabilizers - And I'm guessing
rotator cuff is part of that, which is good.

### Bench press

Ok so I've literally never done a bench press so this was fun. And by fun, I
mean horrifying.

We did 5 sets of three [close grip bench
presses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEF0bv2FW94), at 80%. After the bench
presses, we were to do as many UB (unbroken) reps as possible of ring pushups.
Ring pushups are definitely harder to do, but they're so much easier on the
wrists, so I'm into it. Because I've literally never done a bench press, I
don't have a max rep number. In fact, I don't have **any** number in mind. I
started with a naked barbell and ramped up to a cool 75lbs.

_Aside: I grabbed the women's bar. The coach wanted to demonstrate first, which
is good, and he used my bar. He noticed I grabbed the women's bar and let me
know that I grabbed the women's bar. And yes, It was intentional. I've never
bench pressed and I think being conservative is the best move for me. I think I
will be grabbing the women's bar at least for a few months. :neutral_face:_


#### Personal Notes

- On the fifth/last set, 75lb was difficult but not impossible. I think 85lb
  might be a better 80%, making my 100% be somewhere around 105lb, though this
  doesn't make too much sense because I can do diamond or close grip pushups
  and my weight fluctuates around 150lb.. I don't know anything :man_shrugging:
- The coach set the J-hook rack position and I think it was just a touch too
  high for me. I think a good position for me is the highest slot of the
  sequence of close slots. I don't know, I was struggling a bit to rack the
  barbell.
- Make sure the barbell is inline in your eyes to prevent the barbell from
  hitting the hooks because it's too close.
- Elbows forward; Forearms should be moving in-line up and down.
- Barbell should reach your sternum.
- Arch your back.
- Try your best not to sag during ring pushups.


### WOD

The WOD was four rounds for time, 16 minute cap:
- 400m run
- 15 left arm kettlebell snatch @ 25lb (Rx: 53lb)
- 15 right arm kettlebell snatch

I was able to finish at 15:31 -

_I went into the workout thinking we only needed to do three rounds. That was a huge mistake._


### Kettlebell Snatch

More snatches! And I'm **still** not doing it so well! One day!

The coach demo'd how to do a kettlebell snatch; It's all in the wrist, baby!
I was practicing on the 25lb, as it was considered "lighter". The coach was
demo'ing on a 35lb and had me try the 35lb; I couldn't do it as smoothly so the
coach had me use the 25lb. I was good because it just solidifies for me that
form should rule all. 

I guess if you don't need the weight to come from the ground, you don't need to
put the weight down too low. I had the kettlebell end fairly close to the
ground, in a fairly deep squat and low back. The coach corrected me and
mentioned it should be more close to your lower crotch. Use your hips! Jump!
Find the balance between zipping up directly up and not zipping up at all!

I'm definitely getting more comfortable with the snatching motion, but it's
nowhere near being perfect. **But any progress is good progress!**

I was toast at the end of the workout, but it was a good toast. I think this
was considered one of the lighter days, I think because the next day is the
first day of the CrossFit Open (20.1). So if anyone does come to class, they'll
be alright to compete. I, for one, will not be competing. I think I'm better
off not throwing myself at these workouts; Even the scaled versions seem overly
taxing for someone who just started a week ago.
