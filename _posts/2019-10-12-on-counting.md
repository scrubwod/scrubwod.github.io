I've been to three official CrossFit classes, and every WOD I have lost count
*somewhere*.  Whether it's counting 150 unbroken reps of jump rope singles or
15 snatches, I can unabashedly say that I am a scrub at counting.

It's usually around 16, where I hit a little loop:

> "... 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, (wait did I do 16?), 16, 17, 17, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, ..."

By that time, I've done a handful of extra reps. Not a bad thing, but
unnecessary.

**I can't be the only one** who has trouble physically exerting myself and
maintaining an exact counter in my head.

So I looked to the internet for guidance and tips.

### The internet

A quick Google search of ["crossfit losing
count"](https://www.google.com/search?q=crossfit+losing+count), at the time of
writing this post, shows the first result to be a reddit post: ["Does anyone
else have a hard time keeping count? : crossfit -
Reddit"](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/jeqa8/does_anyone_else_have_a_hard_time_keeping_count/).

Classic.

The top reply says:

This is what I've been doing, which makes me feel like I have actually
completed the WODs and maybe plus some. But who knows? Maybe the "lower number"
in my head is actually a number that I never reached! I can't trust myself!

Some users suggest marking down a line somewhere to denote 10 reps. Seems like
too much work.

A user notes:

> The handbook they gave me said: "If you lose count, the next number is 1" ..

This is good. I kind of like this as a training element.

Let's look at other interweb resources, shall we?

A post from 2014, [CrossFit One World: Learn How To
Count!!!!](https://crossfitoneworld.typepad.com/crossfit_one_world/2014/06/learn-how-to-count.html), paints the author in a confused state:

> There is a phenom in CrossFit that I can never understand. The peeps who can’t count! ... I’ve never had a problem counting reps.

Although it seems like the author has a condescending tone, they do mention that:

> .. I always have a plan on how I’m gonna attack the reps in a workout so it’s
> easy to keep track of the reps. If a workout has 20 reps of something I can’t
> do 20 times straight, I have a plan on how many reps I am going to do before
> I take a break in the action.

If I need to break down a set and count something like 6-6-4-4, that's is
pretty easy and I don't think I have miscounted a set where I needed to do such
a thing.

But 150 jump ropes FUCKS ME UP! I'm sure there are some people that can always
count and subvocalize the current number after every rep all the way up to 150
and NOT losing track. I am not a complete idiot, but I am also not this kind of
person.

More scouring of the web shows a few more posts of, what seems like CrossFit
gyms or groups, firmly believing that people like me are intentionally
miscounting to do less work - intentionally cheating.

This is not the case for me.

I will restart at 1 if I have to, *but I don't want to have to*.

I will hit the time cap if I have to.

I am a scrub and I have no shame.

**Lightning Round:**

- [CrossFit DC, Ask The Coach: Keeping Count](https://crossfitdc.com/2016/08/25/ask-the-coach-keeping-count/)
    - Assume the lower number
- [Wildcat CrossFit: Strategies for Counting Reps during a CrossFit WOD](https://www.wildcatcrossfit.com/strategies-counting-reps-crossfit-wod/)
    1. Break into smaller rep counts
    2. Use tools/chalk ticks
    3. Use a pacer (not the best)
    4. Count backwards
- A lot of CrossFit box FAQs:
    - Start at 1 if you lose count

### What I'll do...

So this wasn't the most fruitful investigation. I will try asking around my gym
to see if anyone has any actual techniques.

For me, maybe it has to do with seven consecutive numbers ending in _-TEEN_, or
that I have to subvocalize the prefix of every number after 19.

Not sure how great this will work, but I think my plan is to try practicing
mindfully breaking sets down into 10s and vocalize every set counter to replace
the "1":

> **ZERO**, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
**ONE**, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
**TWO**, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
**THREE**, ...

This makes it so I don't need to subvocalize numbers that sound the same and
confuse myself and I wouldn't need to vocalize every number (but maybe that
would help..).

And maybe prep myself before each workout how many 10s sets I need to vocalize:

> "I need 100 jump ropes, so I'm done when I vocalize **TEN**"

I have not figured out a solid technique that works for me, but if I find one,
I will surely let ya'll know about it.

_Side note: Posts that write condescendingly about people who lose count and
don't offer suggestions bother me. If you're comfortable posting things like
this, it seems to me that you would probably be comfortable criticizing other
aspects of an athlete without helping or actually understanding the problem.
I'm not a coach but that doesn't seem like a great quality. I don't need to
feel more badly about myself just for trying. If these people are coaches or
run gyms, I sure as hell wouldn't want to be a part of their community. But
that's just me..._
