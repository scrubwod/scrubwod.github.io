*(Written retrospectively, so honestly probably forgot something)*

Today was moving around the barbell off of the rack.

### Assault Bike
- Seat height: 4
- Pretty straight forward, but remember that you can use the handle bars to
  push and pull - It's not completely legs

### Pushes

- Bunch of different types of pushes, but each one is just a step different
  than the previous. I figure writing them out and seeing them in a line will
  help me remember the differences:
    - [Strict Shoulder Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe19t2_6yis)
        - Hip-width stance
        - Full grip, outside of shoulders
        - Elbows forward
        - It seems like the full grip limits elbow mobility, preventing far
          elbows like in a [front rack]() position
    - [Push Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaBVSJm78ko)
        - Similar to strict, but bending legs to position self a little bit
          under the barbell to distribute the weight into your legs
        - The coach taught this to me in three steps:
            - Slightly squatting with bar
            - Getting onto toes, bar should reach face-height
            - Catch bar at the top with both legs and arms extended
    - [Push Jerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-hKuAfWNUw)
        - Similar to push press, but you jerk under the bar in the third step,
          catching the bar with arms extended but legs squatting (jumping into
          slightly wider squat with toes slightly outward)
    - [Split Jerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsiO8lZTU2I)
        - Similar to push jerk, but instead of jerking into a slightly wider
          squat, you jump into a lunge
        - The rep is complete when you stand up from the lunge
        - Standing up after the lunge looks so ugly, so I hate the split jerk

### Squats

- [Overhead squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD_vUnqwqqI)
    - Shoulder-width stance
    - Wide full grip
- [Front rack squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ytaCJZpl0)
    - Shoulder-width stance
    - Hands outside of shoulders, loose fingertip grip
        - I don't think my wrists are flexible enough for this, despite how
          much I work on my wrists
- [Back squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ultWZbUMPL8)
    - Shoulder-width stance
    - Hands comfortably outside of shoulders at a full-grip

### Broad Strokes

Remember to activate all of your muscles. You're naturally a sedentary being
and forget to use muscles that you have.

## WOD

For Time:
- 200m Run
- 6 Push Presses
- 7 Front Squats
- 8 Burpees

I actually don't know how long this took me. This was really taxing for me. I
remember the few days after my lats were so sore.
