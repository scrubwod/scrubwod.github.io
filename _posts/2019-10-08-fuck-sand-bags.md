Tuesday. First 6am. Let's get it done!

The morning classes are at 6am and 9am and I should be at work by at least
9:30am, so guess which one I will be a regular at! This should have honestly
been a more significant factor, but I'm already in it and need to be more
comfortable with getting up an at 'em at 5am.

Waking up today wasn't too bad, but let's see if I continue waking up at 5am
and feeling alright.

### Breakfast

Alright so I'm a real scrub at preparing myself food, so my breakfast does not
exist if it's not an almond milk protein shake or granola. I also think I need
to eat a little bit earlier, which means I need to wake up earlier... So...
Damn.

**TODO**: <u>Figure out easy breakfasts to fuel these classes.</u>

### Warm Up

Part of the warm up was a sandbag walk for 400m. Not knowing anything, I went
into it all confident, like "Damn this is going to be easy." The coach ended up
giving me the 80lb. What a mistake. I started off real hot, but I had to drop
the bag at 100m, 200m, 300m, 350m.

This took me a little more than 6 minutes. I didn't figure out how to hold it
comfortably. It's hard to breath. I can barely walk.

So now **sandbags are my worst enemy**. Fuck you, sandbags.

### WOD

The WOD was three rounds, 16 minute cap:
- 20 cal row
- 16 alternating dumbbell hang power snatch @ 35lb (Rx: 50lb)
- 14 box handstand pushups (Rx: HSPU)
- 12 20lb medicine ball sit-ups (Rx: GHD Sit-ups)

I finishing at 15:31.


### Rows

Man I think I did so much better at the rows, but still feels like I could give
more power to get the cals quicker. I don't really feel like I'm driving my
heels through as much as I can be. Also I caught myself in a strange hypnosis
where I was mindlessly pulling pretty weakly for a few reps... But other than
that, feeling good!


### Dumbbell Snatch

Still bad at dumbbell snatches. Hang means deadlift up, and then power snatch up.
Again, I need to remember to use my hips. Also my coach mentioned to use my
elbows; She noticed me beginning to use my hips, but then failing to use my
elbows. I'm a scrub. Again. Whoops. I'll get 'em next time!


### Handstand pushups

I was on my knees and wasn't exactly pushing perpendicularly from the ground. I
think the next time I need to substitute with box handstand pushups, I should
aim for a more handstand-like position.


### Medicine ball sit-ups

These were pretty easy when I used the momentum of the medicine ball. I think a
big thing for me to figure out if when to thrash and when to be controlled. I
was trying to be controlled, which made it a bit more challenging, but I think
I could have ripped through the set a lot more quickly. /shrug


### Thoughts

Pretty good session, despite the fucking sandbags.

Starting off, I'm trying to aim for one day on, one day off, and try to ramp
into two or three days on, one day off. Some of the other people in the class
mentioned when they started, they remember always being sore when starting off.
Being sore is fine, but being painfully sore sucks. Body, everything's fine,
stop feeling so hurt. Please.

I think I made my wrist a little angry, not sure when. Shame. Hope it feels
better soon.
