It shouldn't matter what numbers you put on the board as long as you're beating
yourself, so being a beginner is cool as hell; When you're a beginner there's
no shortage of hitting a PR. _Almost every session you can hit a new and easy
PR_ and I love how fulfilling it feels.

### Front Squats

Front squats are cool. We did 5 rounds of 3 reps of squats, building to a
"tough daily set of 3".

As always, I started really light and went into it only adding maybe 10 lbs at
a time. I was crushing it. My squat game is pretty cool. The coach noticed that
I was crushing it and made me swap on 35s. Not too too bad! I was able to add
10s for the final round hitting a PR of 135. My form felt solid with 135, so I
think I could add maybe one more plate. But like I said, *hitting PRs left and
right*!

### The Wod

This WOD was interesting, combining weightless movements with the barbell.

16 min AMRAP

- 2 Rounds of Cindy
    - 5 Pull Ups
    - 10 Push Ups
    - 15 Squats
- 1 Round of DT
    - 12 Deadlifts @ 85lb (rx: 155lb)
    - 9 Hang Power Cleans @ 85lb (rx: 155lb)
    - 6 Push Jerks @ 85lb (rx: 155lb)

I was able to chain the kipping pull ups so that was probably the easiest part
of the workout. Deadlifts at this light weight was cool. Power cleans busted me
up. I don't think I opened my hips as much as I should have. Push jerks were
messed up. I don't know how to cycle through them, so I exerted energy getting
it from overhead back to front rack. My upper traps are burning.

Each round counted as a point, so I was able to do 8+23.

The RX barbell weight seems nuts to me. I couldn't even do three rounds, and
people were crushing it with the RX weights almost hitting four rounds.

I hope CrossFit continues to be fun and exciting for me because I want to reach
that level of strength and efficiency, man. That shit is outrageous to me.
