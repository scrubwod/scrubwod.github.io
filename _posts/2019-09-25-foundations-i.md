*(Written retrospectively, so honestly probably forgot something)*



At the gym that I decided to join, they offered a "No Sweat" introduction to
their box and why I should join them and not anyone else (It seems that most of
the boxes around me offered this.). The coach claimed their equipment is latest
and greatest; That wasn't the selling point for me. I know that the best
equipment in the world won't make you a better
<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;[anything]&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>. It's probably more helpful for the
people who are trying to compete, as you'd want to study with the right
materials. But doesn't matter that much to me.

The part that sold me was that I could tell the coach was crazy passionate
about CrossFit, in a way that someone can't fake. Maybe I'm just projecting
what I hope I gain from CrossFit, but I could tell she went through ups and
downs and became a better person from CrossFit. I consider myself a "[level
seven
susceptible](https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/04/22/community-review-6.07-advanced-safety-features)"
and after this, I was immediately sold and started the sessions a few days
later.

This box requires the members to go through three one-on-one sessions to get
you primed for CrossFit classes. I have no problem with this; I actually prefer
this because I'm a scrub! I need all the help I can get! Jumping into a
CrossFit class without any background sounds horrifying. I'm still horrified
now, but less horrified. The first session comprised of basic movements and an
overview of what kind of equipment was in the gym.

### [Rowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxfhQMbATCw)

- This was suuuuper fun for me
- Form notes:
    - [Jason Khalipa: Quick Rowing Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlWUPkXrq24)
    - Back begins flat with slight forward lean (no rounding of shoulders
    - Legs should fully extended with back up flat
    - Back should fall back from the hips
    - Lats/Arms finally pull to sternum, elbows back
    - Reverse back to start
- Personal notes:
    - I need to remember to drive my power into my heels
    - It feels like I don't lean back enough; Hopefully my hip flexors
      naturally become stronger and allow a greater range of motion

### [Air Squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMvwVtlqjTE)

- Pretty easy for me because I've been doing air squats all my life and I
  basically live in a seated squat position, but my form wasn't exactly as
  prescribed
- Form notes:
    - Shoulder-width stance, toes facing slightly out
    - Push knees out to activate all leg muscles
    - Maintain position of back through movement
    - Hips need to go past knees, heels down
    - Full hip and knee extension at completion
- Fun!

### [Box Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52r_Ul5k03g)

- Man so fun. I don't need to jump vertically like this, so I don't even know
  my maximum or how much power to get me up to a certain height. This is
  detrimental as I'll be wasting energy - Strive for efficiency!
- Form notes:
    - Hip-width stance
    - Both feet simultaneously jump and land
    - Full hip and knee extension at completion
    - Jump or step down for next rep

### Pull Up

- Rep: Chin goes up higher than the bar
- **Remember to engage your shoulders and depress the scapula regardless of
  variation**
- Variations:
    - [Strict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRV5YKKaeVw):
        - This is the only pull up I know...
        - Hands slightly wider than shoulder-width
    - [Kipping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzRo-4pq_AY):
        - This is a direction towards efficiency. I've read a couple of
          articles already that claim, although kipping pull ups is easier in
          that it distributes some of the energy required to pull yourself up,
          you should be able to do a few strict pull ups before moving to
          kipping pull-ups.
        - Kip motion is generated from moving from arched to hollow positions
        - When at the top, this is considered the arched position
        - On the way down, is the hollow position
        - Repeat, at the bottom in the arched position
        - KISS: Hollow position is the in-between of the top and bottom
          positions
    - [Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OenVG15QMj8):
        - I didn't do one of these, but my coach mentioned these, as an even
          **more** efficient pull up rep, where you are cycling the kipping
          motion: The in-betweens become the bottom and top positions.
        - [_This has quickly become a goal_](/personal_goals/)


### Handstands

- I have never done a handstand pushup (and has become a
  [goal](/personal_goals/)), to which the coach had me kick up to the wall and
  walk/crawl up/down the walk.

### [Wall Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpUD0mcFp_0)

- Fun.
- Form notes:
    - Should be about arms distance away from wall
    - Shoulder-width stance, toes facing slightly out
    - Push knees out to activate all leg muscles
    - Hips descend lower than knees
    - Elbows stay off of knees
    - Ball catch should smoothly transition to descended position
- Personal notes:
    - I'm still understanding how much energy to get the ball up. The box has
      the Rogue targets, and I continue to miss reps because I don't hit it
      high enough.
    - This is really fun though. I wish this was in every WOD.

### [Kettlebell Swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdezTMulJ-k)

- Form Notes:
    - Shoulder-width stance, toes facing slightly out
    - Push knees out to activate all leg muscles
    - Hips **do not** need to fall below knees
    - Maintain lumbar curve position throughout movement
    - Arms remain straight (? My coach mentioned that bent arms is sufficient
      for a rep, so straight arms might be a prescription?)
- Personal Notes:
    - During the WOD I was getting fatigued and my body was looking for
      efficiency. This is when I felt motion similar to the kipping pull up,
      where you use hollow and arched positions to pull the weight over your
      head. Similarly, the "arched" position is the top and bottom of the
      movement.

### Broad Strokes

Do everything as efficiently as possible if you want to push for time or
rounds.  If moves don't call for "strict", you can do whatever it takes to get
that rep (kipping, butterfly, etc.), just know exactly what "one rep" means. If
the box over doesn't require a stand at the top, you don't need to do it. If
the pull up isn't strict, then kip.

## WOD

10 Minute AMRAP
- 200m Row
- 14 Air Squats
- 8 Kettlebell Swings
- 8 Pushups
- 6 Pullups

I was able to complete 3 rounds. I was fighting... I also forgot about the
kipping pull up so the first couple I was doing strict pullups!

That morning I was also eating some granola. After the WOD, I kind of wanted to
throw up. I don't think it was the WOD itself that made me want to throw up,
but I think I was allergic to something in the granola. So... Note to self...
Don't try to eat new things before WODs.
