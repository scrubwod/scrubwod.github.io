I would say I am a pretty average man, earning money by typing out
[algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) on a keyboard. I also
just like doing things that are fun for me and that make me happy.

The first gym I joined was an indoor rock climbing gym at the age of 25 and my
only regret is not realizing that I loved climbing earlier.

Before climbing, I was physically mediocre; Luckily I was never entirely out of
shape, but let's just say I did everything in my power to avoid exerting
energy. I think some of the love stems from the ability to physically do
things.

My main motivation for beginning I want to start going to CrossFit classes
regularly. I want to become stronger and more mobile. I don't want my physical
ability to hinder and prevent me from doing something that I want to do. I
think CrossFit will grant me a good foundation for this physical competence.

I also love over-analyzing mediocre things and hopefully this pours into the
minutiae of CrossFit and into these blog posts, detailing form and mentality.

I am always a student and always a scrub. I am always learning and I hope this
outline of a beginner trying to "do CrossFit" helps anyone getting into the
sport.
