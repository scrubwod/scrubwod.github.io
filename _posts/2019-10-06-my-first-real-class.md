It's a very happy Sunday! I love Sundays. Sundays for me are a way to soup
myself up to prep for the week ahead of me.

I relaxed yester-Saturday, but I'm still pretty damn sore from the
deadlifts, cleans, and snatches from Friday (the last of my 1-1 coach
sessions). The bottom of my traps and my hamstrings are petrified; They have no
idea what hit them and they're **SO tight**.

The gym that I joined has a one hour session for rehab-ing aches and pains, and
I decided to go and man was it worth it. I learned and loosened my back and
hamstrings, not completely back to what I would consider "regular", but they
have been revived (for now).

There was also a CrossFit class right after, so I decided to take it. Luckily
the coach that I had the 1-1 sessions with was running the session, so it was
definitely more comfortable for me.

The prescribed WOD was a 20 Minute AMRAP:
- 100 Douple-unders
- 50 Wallballs (20/14)
- 40 Cal Row
- 30 Alternating Dumbbell Snatches (50/35)
- 20 Toes-to-bar
- 10 Muscle ups (*GOALS*)

I ended up finishing one round of:
- 5 Douple-unders + 150 Singles: Unbroken singles
- 50 Wallballs @ 14lb: 10-10-10-10-10
- 40 Cal Row
- 30 Alternating Dumbbell Snatches @ 35lb: 6-6-6-4-4-4
- 20 Trying to get my toes up to the bar: 6-6-4-4
- 10 Box-assisted muscle ups: Singles


### Things to improve

#### Double unders

I can do one double under. And then I can lose track of the rhythm and hit my
feet. And then I can do two double unders and then hit my feet. Double unders
are so damn annoying if you can't get them; Spending time untangling my feet
**suuuucks**.

#### Counting

I haven't figured out a mechanism for me to count correctly. I started jumping
rope, immediately got distracted from bopping to the music, and then forgot
what number I was at - I think I did at least 150 singles, but only God knows
if I really did 150 singles. I started trying to count by 10s after I first
lost count, but then I felt like I was forgetting how many 10s I've completed.

#### Rowing

One thing that the coach pointed out was that my legs should more slowly
retract and to use that time to breathe and rest. I was retracting my arms back
to extended fairly quickly was good, but I think I need to try to get more
speed into the pull.

#### Snatches

Naturally I don't really use the direction of my elbow to help pull the
dumbbell up, so this is something that the coach pointed out around halfway.
She even mentioned this before we started and I heard her, but good on me for
not applying what she said...

I also need to get better at the switch; I passed the dumbbell from one hand to
the other so clunk-ily and inefficiently. I'm sure this ate some energy. I also
need to use my body more: As I was getting more tired, I started to notice that
I was using my hips to help drive the snatch up (as it's supposed to) and
continued until I finished. I need to remember to do this from the get-go for
snatching.

I also learned that alternating means one rep/one hand. My mindset makes one
rep to be after both hands complete their own snatch, so good thing I asked or
else I would have doubled the amount of reps for no reason. **So always ask for
clarification, even if you think you know what it means, because you could be
dead wrong and it will ruin your life.**

#### Toes to bar

Just after doing a few, trying to get my toes higher than normal, I understood
the motion better. I noticed that continuing was easier if I focused on keeping
my feet at the peak of the swing and only start swinging them back down at the
peak. Makes sense: If you try to swing them down before they completely stop,
you're fighting their current velocity because it's moving in the opposite
direction of the force you're applying to swing them back down.

Focusing on the timing to swing your legs down ends up helping your pendulum,
so you can more easily reuse a lot of the same potential energy. **Science!**


#### Muscle Ups

I couldn't do a real muscle up because I didn't really understand the
mechanics. After using the box, I more closely understand how my body could
achieve the movement. I quickly figured out that jumping was getting me up to a
position where my arms were mostly already extended. It was then a matter of a
tiny push up to complete. I don't know if it was cheating, but my body was
already toast at this point of the WOD and I didn't care.

This feels like what I was missing at the first attempt. I didn't use the
kipping motion from my legs to simulate a jump and get my hips closer to the
bar.

I still don't think I can do it without help, but I think I'm in a good
direction for crossing this goal off.


### Thoughts

I don't think these will get any easier, and that's not a bad thing. I think I
just need to be comfortable and ok with being thrashed more-or-less like this
after every class.

Also the other people taking class were really nice and so strong, so I do like
the aspect of being able to do the workout with people so much better than I
am. Where else can I experience something like this? I think this is a really
cool part of CrossFit.

I also got a taste of the community of the gym. Most of the people are very
nice and welcoming. I think a personal goal of mine should be to remember
everyone's name that I meet, and be comfortable asking for their name again
when I forget.

I'm excited to continue!
