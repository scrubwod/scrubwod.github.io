Today sort of tested how hard I'm pushing myself during these classes. I am
still very much going into everything with the mentality of a beginner. It's
only been a little over a month since I actually started true CrossFit classes
and I don't want to fuck myself up too soon. I want to still focus on form.
Though I'm not sure if this is compromising my "gainz".

For things that I've done already, I will start pushing myself. I already have
numbers, and even though most of them aren't my 1RM, I should base the weights
that I choose around them. I've annotated my "Max So Far" with more
information, which should better suit future decisions.

### Overhead Squats

Overhead squats are tough. The hardest part isn't even the squatting part;
Stabilizing the weight is different and tough. The last time I did a true
overhead squat (and not a squat snatch), was during the foundation sessions,
and I think did 65lb then.

We were doing 5x4 reps of OHS at 2-2-2 tempo. My legs are strong, so most of
the weight was on my shoulders and back and core. I started pretty light at
65lb. Felt good, and by the last round, I was at 90lb. I stood the last rep,
but couldn't return it to the back squat position, so I had to drop it. But I
think this means I picked a last good weight, right? Unfortunately I had 10
plates on the barbell because it's easier to add 5s than swap out the 10s for
15s. NTS: Swap immediately to or start with 15s.

I also noticed that my __fingers were going numb__ after each set. That's no
good, right? A little research shows it's because of nerve is being compressed,
the ulnar nerve in particular.

### WOD

20 Rounds, 20 min cap:
- 5 Wall balls @ 14lb (rx: 20lb)
- 3 Box handstand knee pushups (rx: HSPU)
- 1 clean @ 95lb (rx: 225lb)
- I was able to complete the 20 rounds at around 19:50

I was definitely able to keep the pace, but it was still very tough for me.

At the end when we were all saying how many rounds we completed, everyone
completed around 14-16 rounds, which makes me think I went too light.

I think 20lb wall balls are do-able, even though wall balls fuck the shit out
of my quads for the next few days, but whatever. But yes, I should start doing
rx weights for wallballs now.

Even with 20lb wall balls, I think I could still either complete or get at
least 18 rounds. I can't really change the scaled HSPU. Seems like that's the
last scaled version before true HSPU.

My choice for the clean weight was based on my max-so-far weight. It was
literally the heaviest I've power cleaned, so I thought it was a good weight.
Maybe it's way too light and my form has gotten good enough where I can find a
truer 1RM clean. I just didn't want to go into a WOD with a heavier barbell
than I've ever done, but maybe I should have.

Hopefully annotating my "max-so-far" will help direct these future decisions.
